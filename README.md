# Weav

 (App had Parse Backend and no longer runs)


This was an app developed over the period of 7 months with 4 other UC Berkeley Engineering Students.
The core idea behind this app was that every social interaction with a group of people is a living thing (A Weav). Every Weav had three distinct components, a location, a time period, and the people inside. All photos taken through the app were shared in an open feed. Users could interact with the feed by leaving comments and likes. The most interacted photos would rise to the top of the feed. This style of social media best fit concerts and other public events where people didnt necessarily know each other but were all in the same place under a common interest.
